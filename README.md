**Try not to look at others' solutions before completing the problem yourself!**

## Adding your solutions

You should create a fork of this repository and write your solutions there. To edit your forked version, either use Git to locally clone it to your computer or create a GitHub Codespace. Make sure to follow the outlined [repository structure](#repository-structure).

Once you have written and verified your solutions, commit them to your local fork and open a pull request to merge changes to the main repository. Make sure to keep your fork synced!

Please do not commit any extraneous files! Add files to a [.gitignore](https:/git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring) if necessary.

## Repository Structure

Each day will have its own directory following the naming scheme `day-xx`. For example, the first day will have a folder called `day-01` and the twelfth day will have a folder called `day-12`

Since each day has 2 parts, the folder for each day will contain two other folders titled `part-1` and `part-2`. Put your respective solutions in each folder.

Name your solution files following the scheme `<Your Name>_<day # (0-padded)>_<part #>.<extension>` (e.g. `Thomas_01_1.java` or `Shubh_11_2.py`)
